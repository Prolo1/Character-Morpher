# Character Morpher
## Description
This mod allows for the user to set a morph target and change any character to look like the target (with a few sliders in character maker). As of now the changes in character maker are applied to every character (may change that later). It also only works on female cards, not actively planning on both genders (I might though)

## How To Use
1. Open the mod settings
2. Find "Character Morpher" and add the path to the character you want to use as a morph target
3. Open up character maker (in game or from main menu)
4. go to "Chara Morph" under personality settings
5. use the sliders to morph different aspects of the character
69. Enjoy!

## Known Issues
* changing morph values to far extremes may cause issues loading subsequent characters in maker. When this happens just close maker and open it back up (this isn't a problem in game since you cant use the sliders)
* With KK[SS], trying to change OG face and body sliders will change bust values to original state, that's because the sliders don't change when values change internally so keep that in mind (using the character morpher sliders will turn it back)
