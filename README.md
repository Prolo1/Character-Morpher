## Description

This mod allows the user to set a morph target and change any character to look like the target (with a few sliders in character maker). ~~As of now the changes in character maker are applied to every character (may change that later)~~ (I changed it). It also ~~only works on female cards, not actively planning on both genders (I might though)~~ (forgot to change that, it has worked for a while now ðŸ˜œ).

## Known Issues

* ~~changing morph values to far extremes may cause issues loading subsequent characters in maker. When this happens just close maker and open it back up (this isn't a problem in game since you can't use the sliders)~~ (Fixed this to the best of my knowledge)
* ~~With KK[S], trying to change OG face and body sliders may change bust values to the original state, that's because the original sliders don't update when values change internally so keep that in mind (using the character morpher sliders will turn it back)~~ (This should be fixed too)
* some people when using sliders, may have seen the sliders snap back to their original values on release. this is most likely a config issue which should be fixable in 2 ways (I'm not quite sure). Option 1, press the "Save Default" button in Maker, and close and open the Maker if it doesn't work immediately. Option 2, find the mod config file in `"root_game_folder/BepInEx/Config/prolo.chararmorpher.cfg"` and delete it while the game is off **(THIS WILL DELETE ALL SAVED SETTINGS)**, then re-launch the game.
