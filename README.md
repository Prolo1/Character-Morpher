# Character Morpher
## Description
This mod allows for the user to set a morph target and change any character to look like the target (with a few sliders in character maker). As of now the changes in character maker are applied to every character (may change that later). It also only works on female cards, not actively planning on both genders (I might though)

## Linked Mods

## Known Issues
* ~~changing morph values to far extremes may cause issues loading subsequent characters in maker. When this happens just close maker and open it back up (this isn't a problem in game since you cant use the sliders)~~ (Fixed this to the best of my knowlage)
* With KK[S], trying to change OG face and body sliders change bust values to original state, that's because the original sliders don't change when values change internally so keep that in mind (using the character morpher sliders will turn it back)
